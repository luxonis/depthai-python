Messages
========

Messages are sent between linked :ref:`Nodes`. The only way nodes communicate with each other is by sending messages from one to another.

If we have :code:`Node1` whose output is linked with :code:`Node2`'s input, a **message** is created in the :code:`Node1`,
sent out of the :code:`Node1`'s output and to the :code:`Node2`'s input.

On the table of contents (left side of the page) all messages are listed under the :code:`Messages` entry. You can click on them to find out more.
