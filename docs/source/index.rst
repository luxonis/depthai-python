DepthAI API Documentation
=========================

   :target: https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Python+Wheel+CI%22+branch%3A%22gen2_develop%22

DepthAI API allows users to connect to, configure and communicate with their OAK devices.
We support both :ref:`Python API <Python API Reference>` and :ref:`C++ API <C++ API Reference>`.

- **Host side** is a computer, like PC or RPi, to which an OAK device is connected.
- **Device side** is the OAK device itself. If something is happening on the device side, it means that it's running on the `Myriad X VPU <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu/movidius-myriad-x.html>`__. More :ref:`information here <components_device>`.
- **Pipeline** is a complete workflow on the device side, consisting of :ref:`nodes <Nodes>` and connections between them. More :ref:`information here <components_device>`.
- **Node** is a single functionality of the DepthAI. :ref:`Nodes` have inputs or outputs, and have configurable properties (like resolution on the camera node).
- **Connection** is a link between one node's output and another one's input. In order to define the pipeline dataflow, the connections define where to send :ref:`messages <Messages>` in order to achieve an expected result
- **XLink** is a middleware that is capable to exchange data between device and host. :ref:`XLinkIn` node allows sending the data from the host to a device, while :ref:`XLinkOut` does the opposite.
- **Messages** are transferred between nodes, as defined by a connection. More :ref:`information here <components_messages>`.

Above there's a graph representation of a (more complex) 2-stage pipeline of the `age-gender recognition demo <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/gen2-age-gender>`__.
Graph contains different :ref:`Nodes` connected (linked) to each other. `DepthAI Pipeline Graph <https://github.com/geaxgx/depthai_pipeline_graph#depthai-pipeline-graph-experimental>`__
tool was used to generate this image.

Getting started
---------------

First, you need to :ref:`install the DepthAI <Installation>` library and its dependencies.

After installation, you can continue with an insightful :ref:`Hello World tutorial <Hello World>`, or with :ref:`code examples <Code Samples>`, where different
node functionalities are presented with code.
