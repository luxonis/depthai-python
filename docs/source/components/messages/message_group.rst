MessageGroup
============

The MessageGroup message type is a versatile container used in DepthAI pipelines to group together a map of arbitrary DepthAI messages. It serves as the primary output of the :ref:`Sync` node, effectively synchronizing various input streams, and acts as the input to the :ref:`MessageDemux` node for subsequent disaggregation and processing. 

Creating MessageGroup
#####################

MessageGroup can be created automatically by the Sync node as it aligns and groups messages from different sources based on their timestamps. Alternatively, it can be manually constructed in a host application or within a :ref:`Script` node to create custom groupings of DepthAI messages.
