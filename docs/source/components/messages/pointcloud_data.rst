PointCloudData
==============

`PointCloudData` encapsulates 3D spatial information, representing a collection of points in a 3D space. Each point within the point cloud can have attributes such as position (X, Y, Z coordinates), and potentially other features like color or intensity, depending on the configuration. This data structure is pivotal for applications involving 3D scene understanding, spatial analysis, and interactive environments.

Sources of `PointCloudData` include depth sensing technologies, such as stereo vision cameras and structured light or time-of-flight sensors. In the DepthAI ecosystem, point cloud data is primarily derived from depth maps generated by the :ref:`StereoDepth` node.

Examples of functionality
#########################

- :ref:`3D Object Reconstruction`: Utilizing point clouds to recreate the shape and appearance of objects in three dimensions.
- :ref:`Environmental Mapping`: Generating detailed 3D maps of environments for navigation and understanding spatial layouts.
- :ref:`Spatial Analysis`: Analyzing point clouds for measurements, object detection, and scene segmentation.
