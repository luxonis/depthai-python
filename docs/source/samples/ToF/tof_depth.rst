ToF depth
=========

This is a sample code that showcases how to use the ToF sensor. The :ref:`ToF node <ToF>` converts raw data from the ToF sensor into a depth map.

Demo
####

This demo was recorded using the `OAK-D SR PoE <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/OAK-D-SR-POE/>`__, that's why we selected CAM_A port
on the ToF sensor.

With keyboard you can configure ToF settings:

* *FPPN Correction*; Turn on/off with `f`. It's a process that corrects the fixed pattern noise (FPN) of the ToF sensor. Should be enabled.
* *Wiggle Correction*: Turn on/off with `w`. It's a process that corrects the wiggle effect of the ToF sensor. Should be enabled.
* *Temperature Correction*: Turn on/off with `t`. It's a process that corrects the temperature effect of the ToF sensor. Should be enabled.
* *Optical Correction*: Turn on/off with `o`. It's a process that corrects the optical effect (On -> ToF returns distance represented by Green Line), so it matches stereo depth reporting.
* *Phase Unwrapping* - Process that corrects the phase wrapping effect of the ToF sensor. The higher the number, the longer the ToF range, but it also increases the noise.

  * `0` - Disabled, up to ~1.87 meters
  * `1` - Up to ~3 meters
  * `2` - Up to ~4.5 meters
  * `3` - Up to ~6 meters
  * `4` - Up to ~7.5 meters
