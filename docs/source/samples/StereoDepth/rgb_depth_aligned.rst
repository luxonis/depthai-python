RGB Depth alignment
===================

This example shows usage of RGB depth alignment. Since OAK-D has a color and a pair of stereo cameras,
you can align depth map to the color frame on top of that to get RGB depth.

In this example, rgb and depth aren't perfectly in sync. For that, you would need to add :ref:`Software syncing`, which
has been added to the `demo here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/gen2-syncing#host-rgb-depth-sync>`__,
where RGB and depth frames have sub-ms delay.

By default, the depth map will get scaled to match the resolution of the camera sensor we want to align to. In other words, if
depth is aligned to the 1080P color sensor, StereoDepth will upscale depth to 1080P as well.
Depth scaling can be avoided by configuring :ref:`StereoDepth`'s ``stereo.setOutputSize(width, height)``.

To align depth with **higher resolution color stream** (eg. 12MP), you need to limit the resolution of the depth map. You can
do that with ``stereo.setOutputSize(w,h)``. Code `example here <https://gist.github.com/Erol444/25f374fa18efa7939ec9bb848b39249a>`__.


Host alignment
--------------

StereoDepth node aligns depth map to selected sensor (in this case, color sensor), on the OAK device itself. One can also do the same
on the host side. We have developed a simple `demo script here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python/commit/94b3177f5f4b28e562f637dcf77baa47826ef643>`__.
